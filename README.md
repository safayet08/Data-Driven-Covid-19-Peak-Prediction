# Data-Driven-Covid-19-Peak-Prediction

After breaking out in Bangladesh and India, two of the most densely populated countries in the South Asia, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) cases are rising furiously with a high effective reproduction number{(R}_0). The purpose of this study is to forecast the epidemic peak for Bangladesh and India, two of the world’s most populated countries by training a model using machine learning and data fitting numerical techniques based on the demographic features of the 19 European countries who have reached their peak already as training set. Based on the publicly available data on the Worldometer from late January till May 28th, a linear model has been proposed and calibrated with rigorous cross validation dataset to estimate the epidemic peak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID 19) for Bangladesh and India. The need to know the probable date of reaching the peak comes from the urgency to prepare the healthcare system accordingly so that when the number of affected reaches the peak, the system doesn’t collapse upon the pressure. With inadequate ICU and ventilator support and not all hospitals serving COVID patients, it's beyond doubt that the healthcare system is going to take a heavy blow. Given the fact that the pandemic wave will be with us for a foreseeable future, in our model, we estimate an approximate time of the peak with the demographic features that will give a heads up about the time left in hand so that the nation can prepare for the best fight.
